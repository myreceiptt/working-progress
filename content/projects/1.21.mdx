I usually use this icon for the profile picture on my profile page on any platform on the Internet, and I especially use this icon as the marker for my version 1.21 progress.   
   
When an anonymous creates an account on primitives.XYZ on April 2024, the anonymous used this icon for the profile picture on the profile page which also became an asset for transferable one of one NFT on the primitives.XYZ platform.
