We were invited to be one of the guest speakers at the "**Temu NFT & Web3 Surabaya**" along with several other speakers from the OKX Wallet, Pelita Bangsa Academy, the NFT and Web3 communities in **Surabaya**.

**Temu NFT & Web3 by IDNFT** is a roadshow program to various cities in **Indonesia** for education, socialization, and community engagement in the NFT and Web3 space.

**IDNFT** is the largest NFT and Web3 community in **Indonesia**. They are focused on education and adoption by bridging the gap between industry players and the user base in **Indonesia**. They believe the NFT, Web3, and Blockchain technology bring long-term benefits.

The official domain for IDNFT is IDNFT dot ID including all of its subdomains. The availability of that domain is not our responsibility. Likewise with the domain of Tempo do Co. We will always update as best as we can when there is any change with the domain.

Stay alert! Beware of scams! Hack them all, ethically!
