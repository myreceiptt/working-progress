This is an open edition NFT of artwork as part of "MY RECEIPT of ETH" collection on the Ethereum blockchain that happened simultaneously with the Last Chance for OpenSea Legacy Royalties Enforcement.   
   
The purpose of this artwork is to remind us to stay alert to our personal security in the Web3 ecosystem. Stay unrevealed, stay under the hood, and always use your pseudonymous hood and mask.   
   
Also, Prof. NOTA will use this artwork as unrevealed artwork for any NFT collection that will be released in the future by Prof. NOTA. You can use that too if you want. Okay!
