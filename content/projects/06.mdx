We were invited to be one of the speakers at the Surabaya NFT Meeting along with several other speakers from the NFT and Web3 communities in Surabaya.

Temu NFT by IDNFT is a roadshow program to various cities in Indonesia for education, socialization, and community engagement in the NFT and Web3 space.

IDNFT is the largest NFT and Web3 community in Indonesia. They are focused on education and adoption by bridging the gap between industry players and the user base in Indonesia. They believe the NFT, Web3, and Blockchain technology bring long-term benefits.
