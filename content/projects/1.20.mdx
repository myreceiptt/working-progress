[![](/1.20.jpg)](/1.20.jpg)

I usually use this image for the banner or the background on my profile page on any platform on the Internet, and I especially use this image as the marker for my version 1.20 progress.   
   
When an anonymous creates an account on primitives.XYZ on April 2024, the anonymous used this image for the banner on the profile page which also became an asset for free open unlimited edition NFT on the primitives.XYZ platform.
