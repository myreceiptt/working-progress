When our progress reached version 7.47, we also finished this collection. This is the first collection that is titled with the same name /ˈdeTH ˌwiSH/ and released on Foundation.App marketplace.   
   
In this self-titled collection, His desire for death is interpreted as an anonymous metaverse figure wearing a hooded cloth, in any kind of place, in the 0101 Universe, and using any technology to be ready to bring death by harvesting anyone's soul.
