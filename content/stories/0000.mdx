## 0101 init...

In computer programming, **initialization** (or **initialisation**) is the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable. The manner in which initialization is performed depends on the programming language, as well as the type, storage class, etc., of an object to be initialized.

#### So, 0101 init...

...is the assignment of an initial value for all the next `1-on-1` artwork in this collection. What kind of `1-on-1` artwork will be presented in this collection? Shush, it's probably something, probably nothing, it depends on the algorithm of your brain, not **Prof. NOTA's brain**.

See you in the next drop!
