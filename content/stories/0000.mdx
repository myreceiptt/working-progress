## 0101 init...

In computer programming, **initialization** (or **initialisation**) is the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable. The manner in which initialization is performed depends on the programming language, as well as the type, storage class, etc., of an object to be initialized.

## Built with...

- The description is written using Visual Studio Code.

## Installation...

### Initialization...

```ts
import React, { Component } from "react"

export default class extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div><h4>0101: Initialization Page!</h4></div>
      <div>
        <p>Please visit this link: <a href="https://deeplinks.straight-line.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prof. NOTA's Deep Links</a></p>

#### So, 0101 init...

...is the assignment of an initial value for all the next `1-on-1` artwork in [`0101`](/stories/) collection. What kind of `1-on-1` artwork will be presented in this collection? Shush, it's probably something, probably nothing, it depends on the algorithm of your brain, not our brain.

See you in the next drop!
