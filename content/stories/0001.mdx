Hello A(!^#@i,\
\
Thank you for your interest! We can ship to Indonesia. The minimum order amount has to be 75 Euro. Payment must be made in advance. After receiving your order we check availability of your desired items then we bill you for the amount of your order. You can use your credit card to charge your PayPal account. There will be an additional shipping/handling/insurance fee of 12 Euro.\
\
If you don't want to pay by PayPal we will have to send you a bill and you have to wire the money. So the whole process will take about 7-10 days, then.\
