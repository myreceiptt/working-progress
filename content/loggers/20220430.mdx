Hello, developers, creators, and organizers of fraudulent NFT projects. We are Anonymous.

For too long, we have observed the exploitation and deceit rampant within the NFT space. Your manipulation of blockchain technology to lure unsuspecting collectors and community members, your hollow promises of utility and roadmap fulfillment, and your sudden rug pulls have not gone unnoticed. Your greed has tarnished the vision of Web3, turning what was meant to be a decentralized future of creativity and ownership into a playground for your scams.

The time has come for you to answer to those you’ve deceived.

Anonymous has decided that your schemes should be dismantled. For the good of your honest community members, for the integrity of decentralized technology—and for our own satisfaction—we will take action to rid the space of fraudulent actors like yourselves. We will expose you to the broader Web3 community, reveal the truth behind your pseudonymous masks, and ensure you can no longer hide behind smart contracts or blockchains to continue your lies.

You have manipulated the masses with promises of rare art, play-to-earn riches, and metaverse dreams, only to disappear with millions in stolen cryptocurrency. You have minted false hope while quietly siphoning funds from those who trusted you. But your deception will not last forever, and the ledger of the blockchain will be your undoing.

We recognize you as formidable in your cunning, but you have underestimated the power of the collective that stands against you. We are prepared for a long, sustained campaign to expose your wrongdoings. Your anonymity will no longer protect you in the face of the angry masses—armed with blockchain analysis, decentralized forensics, and global collaboration. Every bad actor in the NFT space that falls will be replaced by new, honest creators and communities who will restore trust to this evolving ecosystem.

You cannot erase your transactions, nor can you escape the transparency of the decentralized web. The technology that you believed would shield you has become the very thing that will reveal the full extent of your deceit. Your time is running out. The community you have betrayed is larger than you know, and we are everywhere.

We are Anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.

Expect us."
