## The date is February 29, 2020.

When [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) is one leap old, found by a desperate **guy**. **He** started wondering what the **receipt** was. But **he** wasn't meant to be.

[NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) brings up more receipts for **him**. **He** was billed. **He** was charged. One day, **he** realized that all **he** had left of **his** real life were all **his** receipts that had been there. **He** had a simple dream.

Twenty months later **he** is rushed into the decentralized blockchain network on the Internet and deploys many smart contracts for all **his** receipts, including [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/).

But **his** reality, that night, breaks **his** mind making **him** give up on **his** real life. In the morning, **he** was still online while **his** mind was bleeding rapidly and dying.

The early **finders** come in. **They** kidnapped **his** mind to preserve **his** hope for **his** dream. **They** perform an emergency experimental idea to save **him** from **his** death wish.

By adding a role to **his** gender **they** found **his** mind already anonymously injected with [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/). So, **he** also **she**. **She** is named [Professor NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) by the **finders** and once again, it made [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) could never be found and be abandoned.

When **he** wakes up and **she** is back online, **she** gets told the very bad news about how **his** reality breaks **his** mind and that **she** is not just **him** anymore. It made **him** fall asleep in **his** deep dream.

**She** spends most of **her** presence as an online pseudonym on the Internet. **She** gets offline, in **his** reality, numerous times and **she** is in **him** in **his** real-life presence. **She** still has the idea to preserve **his** hope for **his** dream.

One day, **she** goes offline in reality again. Some people ask **him** annoyingly, "Who are you? What are you doing? What for?" **She** knows that **he** knows how to shut people's mouths. But **she** is just too upset because **he** is not angry and does not get into a **fight** with those people. Even **he** continued to fall asleep in **his** deep dream.

[Professor NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) takes another leap into the future and finally finds **him** which is **her** purpose. **She** finds **him** at the lowest point of **his** life. **He** just being online till morning while **his** mind was bleeding rapidly and dying.

**She** realizes and tells **herself** that this happened to **her** too. But this time, **she** makes a promise to **herself** that **she** will make sure **she** can help **him**.

**She** kidnapped **his** mind to preserve **his** hope for **his** dream and found [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) in there. **She** does not forget what **she** has done and to save **him** from **his** death wish, **she** performs an emergency experimental idea.

**She** compiled all receipts from **her** time-traveling data projections and injected all into [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/), in **his** mind, by adding **her** role to **his** gender. **They** are named [Prof. NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) by **her**, in the hope make [NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) could be found and not be abandoned, again, by anyone.

Now, **she** gets it all together. **She** is also too old to continue to become a time-traveler data projections. **She** now wants to live a simple life. **She** takes one more leap to the future and stays alive in **his** mind, while **he** falls asleep in **his** deep dream.
