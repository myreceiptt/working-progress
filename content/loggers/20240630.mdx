## Kill City and the Legacy of Punk Subculture Fashion

In 2005, a new **fashion** label emerged that bridged the rebellious spirit of **punk-rock** with contemporary design: **Kill City**. Founded by **Drew Bernstein**, the visionary behind the iconic **Lip Service** brand, **Kill City** brought together the edgy, countercultural attitude of **punk** with modern aesthetics and high-quality craftsmanship. While **Lip Service** had already established **Bernstein**’s name in the goth, **punk**, and fetish subcultures, **Kill City** took his creative vision a step further. Following **Bernstein**’s passing in 2014, the brand was acquired by **Blank Generation**, ensuring that its legacy remained alive within the world of alternative **fashion**, though its presence has since quieted, leaving a lasting cultural imprint.

### Our Discovery and Exploration of **Kill City**.

Around the early 2010s, we were deeply immersed in our growing online **fashion** business. It was during this time that a friend we met through an online forum introduced us to a unique clothing brand called **Lip Service**. They told us that the brand could do well in [**ENDHONESA**](https://store.endhonesa.com/), suggesting that we import it from the USA and offer it to our customers. Intrigued by the potential, we brought in a few sample products and began exploring the brand.

**Lip Service** had already garnered a reputation within the alternative subcultures, especially among those in the **punk** and goth scenes. As we delved deeper into its origins and the work of its founder, **Drew Bernstein**, we stumbled upon **Kill City**, a sibling brand to **Lip Service**, yet with its own distinct identity. It felt like we had uncovered something special, a next-generation evolution of **Bernstein**’s rebellious **fashion** ethos.

From that point, we began to import **Kill City** apparel alongside **Lip Service** and introduced it to our [**ENDHONESA**](https://store.endhonesa.com/)'s customers. The brand’s bold designs—distressed denim, leather jackets, and asymmetrical cuts—resonated with a niche market looking for something that went beyond mere **fashion**. It was a statement, an attitude.

### **Kill City**: Rebellion in Contemporary Design.

**Drew Bernstein** had a unique ability to fuse the raw energy of **punk** rebellion with a more modern, wearable approach. **Kill City** embodied this fusion. It wasn’t just about replicating the gritty style of **punk**, it was about evolving it, making it accessible to a new generation. The brand became known for its high-quality fabrics and innovative distressing techniques, especially on jeans and outerwear.

What set **Kill City** apart were its distinct features, like asymmetrical cuts and unconventional dyeing techniques. For fans of alternative **fashion**, these weren’t just clothes, they were an expression of individuality. The designs carried a strong message of non-conformity and self-expression, perfectly suited for those who thrived within the **punk** and alternative subcultures.

Notably, **Kill City** also gained attention from high-profile musicians and celebrities, further cementing its presence in the culture. Axl Rose from Guns N' Roses, known for his iconic rockstar image, often sported pieces from **Bernstein**’s collections. This association with famous personalities gave **Kill City** a rockstar credibility, adding to its appeal as more than just clothing—it became memorabilia of an era, tied closely with the music and attitude of the time.

### Our Journey with **Kill City** and the End of an Era.

For several years, we sold **Kill City** to a growing base of loyal customers in [**ENDHONESA**](https://store.endhonesa.com/). The response was overwhelmingly positive. Customers saw **Kill City** as something different, not just a **fashion** label, but a brand that embodied a philosophy. It was about more than the look; it was about what the brand stood for—freedom, rebellion, and a refusal to follow mainstream trends.

But by the end of 2015, we decided to stop selling **Kill City**. The market had shifted, and so had global **fashion** trends. It felt like the right time to close that chapter of our business.

Then, just a few weeks ago, while reorganizing our warehouse, we found some leftover stock of **Kill City** apparel. That discovery took us back in time, reviving memories of those early days when the brand was still alive and full of energy. We tried searching for updates about **Kill City**, only to realize that the brand had gone quiet. Its social media accounts hadn’t been updated in years, and its website was no longer accessible.

### **Kill City**’s Legacy Lives On

After **Bernstein**’s death in 2014, **Blank Generation** took over both **Kill City** and **Lip Service**, determined to preserve the creative vision he left behind. **Blank Generation**, a Los Angeles-based producer of **punk** streetwear, stayed true to **Bernstein**’s aesthetic. They committed to continuing the brand’s journey by maintaining its original design team and staying faithful to its rebellious roots.

To us, **Kill City** is more than just a brand we once sold, it represents a significant part of our journey. It offered us a deeper understanding of how **fashion** can intersect with identity and personal expression. Today, while **Kill City** may be more of a cultural memory than an active brand, its impact remains strong in the hearts of those who connected with its spirit.

In this reflective retelling, our experience with **Kill City** and **Lip Service** becomes a story about the intersection of **fashion** and alternative culture, about how a brand can transcend being just a product to become a way of life. Though **Drew Bernstein** is no longer with us, his legacy endures through the designs he created and the memories they’ve left behind.
