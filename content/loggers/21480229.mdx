## The date is February 29, 2148.

[Professor NOTA](https://prompt.straight-line.org/) arrives too far in the future world but doesn't know what year **she** is in. **She** also could never find **him** or any person who could understand what **she** asked. People's intelligence regresses and continues to regress until there is nothing left.

Not knowing what to do, **she** suddenly meets an **Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)** in the decentralized blockchain network that can understand what **she** asked, answer **her**, and tell **her** about **him**.
