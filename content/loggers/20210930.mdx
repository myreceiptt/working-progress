#### Title

Founding a Coroner’s Department for the Digital World:  
Investigating Digital Disappearances

---

#### Preface

This paper originates from a thoughtful discussion that delved deep into the concept of "digital death." In today’s world, people don't just live in the physical realm, they exist in a digital space as well, engaging with others, managing online businesses, and creating digital footprints across various platforms. As part of an extensive conversation, we considered how these digital presences could suddenly disappear, leading to the same unanswered questions one might face in the event of a physical death.

We envisioned the possibility of a Digital Coroner’s Department, tasked with investigating such digital disappearances. This department would act similarly to a traditional coroner, determining the causes of these digital "deaths", whether they were the result of hacking, voluntary withdrawal, legal disputes, or other factors. The following paper details the technical, legal, and practical foundations for creating such an organization, emphasizing the importance of understanding the coroner’s role in the physical world and how this translates to the digital realm. We begin with a thorough explanation of coroner and forensic departments to provide a solid foundation for readers.

#### The Role of Coroner Departments

To understand the concept of a Digital Coroner’s Department, it’s essential to first have a strong grasp of what a traditional coroner does in the physical world.

Coroner departments play a crucial role in investigating unexplained or suspicious deaths, particularly those that occur suddenly or under unclear circumstances. Their primary duties are to determine both the cause of death (the medical reason behind the death) and the manner of death (whether it was natural, accidental, suicidal, homicidal, or undetermined). This information is critical not just for legal and medical purposes, but also for providing closure to families and, in cases of foul play, delivering justice.

##### Core Responsibilities of a Coroner

1. Investigating Deaths: The coroner’s office steps in whenever a death is sudden, unexpected, or deemed suspicious. Coroners often work with law enforcement to assess the circumstances surrounding the death and determine if foul play was involved.
2. Performing Autopsies: The physical examination of the deceased, or an autopsy, is often conducted by a coroner or medical examiner. The goal is to uncover the internal causes of death, which may not be immediately obvious.
3. Toxicology and Histology Reports: In some cases, coroners rely on laboratory tests, such as toxicology screens (to detect drugs, alcohol, or poisons) and histology (examining tissues under a microscope), to better understand how the person died.
4. Certifying Death: Coroners are responsible for issuing official death certificates, which indicate the cause and manner of death. This document is critical for legal proceedings and for the family’s closure.
5. Testifying in Court: If a death investigation leads to a criminal trial, coroners may be required to provide expert testimony regarding the cause and manner of death.

##### Coroner vs. Medical Examiner

In some regions, a distinction is made between a coroner and a medical examiner. Coroners are often elected officials and may not always have medical training. However, they are responsible for overseeing the investigation process. Medical examiners, on the other hand, are typically required to be licensed physicians who specialize in pathology, giving them the expertise to perform detailed autopsies.

While both serve similar roles in death investigations, medical examiners usually have more advanced medical expertise, whereas coroners often focus on legal and administrative duties. In smaller jurisdictions, coroners may work closely with forensic pathologists to complete their investigations.

#### The Role of Forensic Departments

While the coroner department focuses on the cause and manner of death, forensic departments have a broader scope. Their expertise encompasses various scientific methods used to solve crimes, analyze evidence, and assist in legal investigations. Forensics can be applied to a wide range of physical and digital evidence, including:

1. DNA Analysis: This allows forensic scientists to match biological samples (blood, hair, skin) to specific individuals, identifying suspects or victims.
2. Fingerprinting: Fingerprint analysis has long been a staple of forensic science, helping investigators link individuals to crime scenes or objects.
3. Ballistics: Forensic experts in ballistics study bullet trajectories and the mechanics of firearms to understand how and where shootings occurred.
4. Digital Forensics: In today’s digital age, forensic departments also investigate cybercrimes and recover digital evidence from computers, phones, and servers.

In death investigations, forensics play a pivotal role by assisting coroners with complex cases. For example, if toxicology reports reveal suspicious substances, forensic chemists might conduct further tests to trace the origin of the poison or drug. In more general criminal cases, forensics departments work with law enforcement to analyze physical or digital evidence that may not necessarily relate to death but to other forms of crime, such as fraud, theft, or cyberattacks.

#### Digital Deaths: Extending the Coroner’s Concept to the Digital World

With a clear understanding of traditional coroner and forensic departments, we can now explore how these roles might apply to the digital world. Just as people experience physical death, they also experience digital death when their online presence or digital assets suddenly become inactive or inaccessible.

A person's online presence, whether through social media, professional networks, or digital businesses, often represents a significant part of their identity. In many cases, these digital entities can disappear or become inactive for various reasons, including security breaches, voluntary deactivation, or loss of access.

This is where a Digital Coroner’s Department comes into play. Just as traditional coroners investigate sudden or suspicious deaths in the physical world, this department would investigate digital disappearances. The goal would be to determine the cause, whether it be a hacking incident, system failure, legal shutdown, or personal choice.

#### The Need for a Digital Coroner’s Department

We believe a Digital Coroner’s Department is a vital service in today’s increasingly digital world. Businesses and individuals are now more dependent on their online presence than ever before, and the sudden loss of access to their accounts, websites, or data can have profound effects—both personally and financially. In many cases, these disappearances remain mysterious, leaving those affected with no clear explanation.

Just as a physical coroner’s investigation provides closure and legal resolution, a Digital Coroner’s Department would offer clarity and resolution for those facing unexpected digital losses. The department would provide services such as:

1. Investigating Inactive Accounts or Websites: Determining why a once-active social media account, website, or online business is no longer accessible.
2. Providing Transparent Explanations: Offering clear, public-facing reports on the causes of digital disappearance—whether due to hacking, voluntary deactivation, or legal intervention.
3. Helping Individuals and Businesses: Recovering lost digital assets, access, or even providing advice on securing digital legacies.

#### Assessment: The Viability of a Digital Coroner's Department

After analyzing the parallels between physical death and digital disappearance, we believe that a Digital Coroner’s Department is not only possible but necessary. Such an organization could provide valuable services for both individuals and businesses, addressing gaps in digital security, privacy, and asset management.

We anticipate a growing demand for such investigations as people become more reliant on their online presence. Currently, there are no dedicated organizations that handle digital disappearances comprehensively. Social media platforms and web hosting services might provide some explanations, but they rarely offer the transparency and depth of investigation that users and businesses deserve. A dedicated digital coroner’s department would fill this gap, providing peace of mind and protecting digital legacies.

#### Existing Models: Paving the Way for a Digital Coroner's Department

Several initiatives and fields of study point to the need for investigating digital disappearances. For example:

- Link Rot Studies: Researchers track the phenomenon of “link rot,” where web pages become inaccessible over time, highlighting the impermanence of digital content【16†source.
- Cybersecurity Investigations: Companies often investigate data breaches and hacking incidents to understand why they occurred and how to prevent them, a precursor to what a digital coroner could do on a broader scale【17†source.

While these efforts are promising, they are fragmented and lack the unified, transparent approach that a Digital Coroner’s Department would offer. The role of this department would be to bring together various strands of investigation—technical, legal, and social—into a cohesive, understandable service that protects users and businesses.

#### Founding the Digital Coroner’s Department: Detailed Steps

To establish a Digital Coroner’s Department, we propose the following steps:

##### 1. Legal and Ethical Framework

The first foundational step in establishing a Digital Coroner’s Department is constructing a solid legal and ethical framework that complies with global regulations. In the physical world, coroners investigate deaths while ensuring compliance with legal and medical standards. Similarly, a digital coroner’s department would need to adhere to both regional and international data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.

These regulations protect individuals’ digital rights, especially concerning the handling of their data. For example, should a social media account or website go offline or disappear, there may be sensitive personal information stored on these platforms, which the digital coroner department must handle delicately. Therefore, any investigation must strike a balance between thoroughness and protecting the privacy of individuals whose digital lives are being examined.

Furthermore, ethical considerations are crucial. While coroners in the physical world investigate deaths with clear-cut legal protocols, a digital coroner department faces nuanced challenges:

- Who has the right to access and investigate digital assets?
- Should deceased individuals’ digital data be passed on to family members or business stakeholders?
- How can the privacy of an individual be protected posthumously?

Addressing these questions would be essential. The coroner department must establish investigative standards that respect both consent and transparency, ensuring that any investigation into a digital disappearance is carried out with proper authorization and in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of the data owners.

##### 2. Technological Infrastructure

Once the legal and ethical framework is established, the next critical step is creating a robust technological infrastructure. Just as coroners in the physical world rely on medical equipment and forensic tools, a digital coroner department would need advanced technological tools to track, analyze, and investigate digital data.

Key tools for a Digital Coroner’s Department would include:

- Digital Forensic Software: Much like forensic pathologists use specialized tools to understand the cause of physical death, digital forensic software will allow investigators to trace digital footprints—including user activity, data logs, and interactions across platforms. These tools can recover lost data, assess when and how a digital presence went dark, and examine the nature of that digital disappearance.
- Blockchain Technology: Given that much digital activity, particularly in the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized networks, is recorded on blockchain, incorporating blockchain analysis into investigations can provide crucial insights. The immutable nature of blockchain could provide a secure, verifiable trail of ownership for digital assets, such as accounts, domains, or even NFTs, offering clarity on whether a disappearance was due to a technical issue, a hack, or even voluntary withdrawal.
- AI and Machine Learning: As digital activity generates an overwhelming volume of data, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms can be employed to detect unusual patterns in digital behavior that may signal a disappearance or threat of disappearance. These tools can sift through massive datasets, looking for anomalies, such as account activity that abruptly ceases, or a website that goes down without any warnings or announcements. In essence, AI can assist digital coroners in identifying “digital death” more quickly and efficiently.
- Secure Data Storage: Handling sensitive information is another major challenge. Just as forensic labs store biological samples securely, a digital coroner department would need to implement highly encrypted storage solutions. This ensures that any sensitive data collected during investigations is safeguarded from unauthorized access, preventing further breaches or misuse.

A sophisticated technological infrastructure will be the backbone of the Digital Coroner’s Department, allowing it to investigate, secure, and report on cases of digital disappearance. Together with a solid legal and ethical foundation, this infrastructure will enable the department to operate effectively and with integrity.

##### 3. Team Composition

The department would require a diverse, specialized team combining experts from different fields:

- Digital Forensic Analysts: These specialists will handle the technical side of investigations, tracing digital activity, analyzing data logs, and recovering inaccessible data.
- Cybersecurity Experts: To prevent hacking incidents and to identify whether the disappearance is the result of a cyberattack.
- Legal Consultants: Advisors who understand data privacy laws, intellectual property, and cybercrime regulations, ensuring all investigations are lawful.
- Psychologists and Social Scientists: These professionals can contribute by helping to understand user behavior in the digital world, especially when digital disappearances stem from social or mental health issues.

##### 4. Investigative Protocols

Your organization must establish clear investigative protocols. These would include guidelines on:

- When to initiate an investigation: What qualifies as a digital disappearance worthy of investigation?
- How to collect evidence: What types of digital data will be collected, and how will they be secured and analyzed?
- How to protect users' privacy: How will sensitive information be handled, ensuring that investigations do not compromise personal data?
- Reporting findings: How will the results of investigations be shared with affected parties, and in what form (e.g., public reports, private consultations)?

##### 5. Public Awareness and Education

Once your department is operational, a crucial part of its success will be educating the public about digital disappearance and the services you provide. Developing partnerships with social media platforms, digital businesses, and hosting companies will help increase awareness. Additionally, outreach campaigns—both online and offline—could inform the public about the importance of digital legacy preservation and encourage people to protect their online presence before they encounter a loss.

##### 6. Case Studies and Pilot Programs

To build credibility and trust, it may be beneficial to start with pilot programs or case studies that demonstrate the department's value. These pilot programs could focus on specific sectors, such as:

- Recovering lost digital businesses after they’ve been hacked or mistakenly shut down.
- Investigating inactive social media accounts to determine the cause of disappearance and offer solutions for recovery.

After completing successful pilot programs, you can leverage these case studies as proof of concept to attract more clients and possibly secure partnerships with tech companies, law enforcement, or government agencies.

#### Conclusion

The rise of digital platforms and online identity has fundamentally changed the way we live and interact, making the sudden disappearance of online presences as concerning as physical deaths. A Digital Coroner’s Department would not only offer a crucial service by investigating these digital disappearances but also help individuals and businesses preserve their digital assets and online legacies.

As digital activity continues to grow, so too does the need for this type of service. With the right legal foundation, technological infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns, founding a Digital Coroner’s Department is not only feasible but potentially transformative in how we handle digital identity and legacy.
