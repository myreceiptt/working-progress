#### 1. The Abstract

What problem the BANANOW.LAND tries to solve and how it does so.

Building and developing a business is not easy for many creators and everyday people. Without a good strategy, the business can fail and even go bankrupt in the first few years.

According to Raymond Chin, many businesses fail because of the lack of digitalization.

As customers, as users, we may be "digital", but in business terms, we don't understand it and not many people have gone digital.

Quoting from the Katadata page, the reasons why businesses still find it difficult to carry out digital transformation are lack of financing, lack of digital training, lack of policy support, no business mentors, and inadequate infrastructure.

On the other side, the way the internet works right now is that creators and everyday people supply the content, and a few companies extract nearly all of the profits from it. Rules, algorithms, and payment structures change, which makes it hard for creators and everyday people to thrive in their creativity.

Knowing that many creators and everyday people need assistance in digital transformation, BANANOW.LAND was created to help meet these needs. We think, that by playing, learning, and working for our creativity, we deserve more control over our creativity to be built and developed as a business.

Moreover, today the industrial world has started to utilize web3 technology, namely blockchain and cryptocurrencies. By harnessing the power of web3 technology, the traditional middlemen controlling the internet are removed, creators and everyday people can have complete ownership of their original works and can build a direct connection between their business, its customers, and its users.

This Green Print aims to describe everything BANANOW.LAND related – from its background, mission, and ecosystem, to existing features brands, and the community.

Additionally, the Green Print also includes the NFTs of the BANANOW.LAND, including but not limited to its information, allocation, utilities, and roadmap.

##### 2.1. The Background

Build a fun, healthy, and mutually supportive family in an organic way.

[PLEASE HELP ME FILL THIS PART!]

[In first paragraph, I want to tell the readers about how the BANANOW.LAND. initiated, what ignite or triger the initiation so the founder planted the first seed in this land.]

[In second paragraph, I want to tell the readers a little bit about the founder. Here I have started it with some sentences.]

The Founder who planted the first seed in this land. A couple of two, who constantly juggle with their kids. "Going BANANAS" becomes the formula to keep both of them smiling and healthy.

[In third paragraph, I want to tell the readers about two other person that join the founder. They are a Web3 developer and a Web3 marketer.]

[In fourth paragraph, I want to tell the readers about where and when finally four of us meet up for the first time, and agree to be the Farmers of the BANANOW.LAND.]

##### 2.2. The Mission

Fully funded by creators and everyday people to brings many usabilities and privileges for them all.

[PLEASE HELP ME FILL THIS PART!]

[In first paragraph, I want to tell the readers about "Let's Go BANANAS" spirit. I have done write it with some sentences.]

"Let's Go BANANAS" is about being whoever we want to be and doing crazy things with dignity. Here we all know, that to "Let's Go BANANAS", the key is financial freedom.

[In second paragraph, I want to tell the readers about how we run the mission of BANANOW.LAND by implementing the spirit of "Let's Go BANANAS".]

[In third paragraph, I want to tell the readers about the reason we utilize blockchain technology in BANANOW.LAND to run the mission. Here I have done write it.]

Blockchain technology and its NFTs can make it easier to assign ownership to specific funds because the operation has the capacity to develop an open ownership structure. There is no requirement for a third party to maintain ownership, and ownership can be immutably recorded.

[In fourth paragraph, I want to tell the readers about the consequences that we will facing but in good way.]

[In fifth paragraph, contain just a sentences as closing statement. Here I have write it.]

So, you could say there are no laws, only consequences.
