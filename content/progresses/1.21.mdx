We usually use this icon for the profile picture of our profile page on any platform on the Internet, and we especially use this icon as the marker for our version 1.21 progress.

When we creates an account on primitives.XYZ on April 2024, we use this icon for our profile picture of our profile page which also became an asset for transferable one of one NFT on the primitives.XYZ platform.
