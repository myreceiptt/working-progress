This is a black and white close-up photo of ALL HAIL's father that was edited by ALL HAIL's father. This photo originally was taken in September 2021 by ALL HAIL, 5 years old kid using his mother's iPhone 8 camera when his father teaching ALL HAIL how to coloring one of his hand drawings.   
   
This photo is an NFT asset on the Tezos blockchain that "MyReceipt" minted on October 01, 2021. But, before the Tezos blockchain, "MyReceipt" was minted two NFT on the Polygon blockchain, the first NFT using the original color version of this photo and the second NFT using this black and white photo version.   
   
Since this is the last photo of MyReceipt before he rests in proxy, this photo marks our version 0.01 progress and we put it on the homepage of some websites we took over from "Mr. MyReceipt".
