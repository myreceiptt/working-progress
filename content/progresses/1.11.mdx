Our version 1.11 progress happens when we are being a **Maxi**. We inscribed this **Maxi** artwork to **Satoshis** to become **Ordinals** on the Bitcoin blockchain.

There are two **Ordinals** on the Bitcoin blockchain inscribed with this **Maxi** artwork, the first is "**The Genesis**", and the second is "**NOTA's Ordinals**".

That **Maxi** artwork is derivative of the "**Bloody Scammer**" artwork we minted on the Tezos blockchain.
