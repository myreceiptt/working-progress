Our 1.47 version progress is marked with this logo. As always, we mint the NFT for this logo and used as a **POET** on the Vitruveo blockchain.

That **POET** is to remind you to stay alert with your personal security. Always protect, support, and help each other to keep our **Web3** community safe! We don't belong in your reality, your real life. In your reality, in your real life, you merely can meet our avatars in any version. Beware of scams!

Stay alert! Beware of scams! Hack them all, ethically!
