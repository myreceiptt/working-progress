# Evergreen Completion Log

- Repo: working-progress
- Branch: evergreening
- Class: A (App Repo)
- Timestamp: 2026-01-17 01:35:52

## Monthly

- Package manager: pnpm 10.28.0
- Node: 24.x
- Outdated (pnpm outdated):
  - @types/node 25.x available, intentionally deferred (stay on 24.x).
- Audit (pnpm audit --audit-level moderate):
  - GHSA-mp2g-9vg9-f4cg (h3 <=1.15.4) via thirdweb > walletconnect > unstorage > h3.
  - Status: deferred (no safe patch/minor update available in current dependency chain).
- Lint: pnpm run lint (pass)
- Build: pnpm run build (pass)
- Live URL parity: not checked in this run.

## Quarterly

- No major upgrades applied.
- Deferred majors:
  - @types/node 25.x (policy: stay on 24.x until approved).

## Notes

- Repo remains buildable with current Node 24.x and pnpm 10.x.
- Audit vulnerability is transitive and tied to thirdweb dependency chain; needs upstream update.
