- Task: Fix Vercel/local boot when THIRDWEB client ID is missing

## Changes
- Made thirdweb client optional when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID` is missing.
- Guarded ConnectButton rendering when client is unavailable.

## Local Checks
- `pnpm install` (warned about ignored build scripts; no approval applied).
- `pnpm run build` (pass with existing x402 warning).
- `pnpm run dev` (server started and ready on http://localhost:3000).

## Deferred Notes (global policy)
- @types/node 25.x deferred across all repos; keep pinned to 24.x until the 25.x migration.
